## Overview

[DMNâ„¢](https://www.omg.org/dmn) specification defines functionality that allows to call
external functions written in Java. Details can be found in the document
**Decision Model and Notation Version 1.4** on pages 117-118 (externally-defined functions).

While [Decision Toolkit](https://github.com/dsntk/dsntk.rs) (**DSNTK**)
is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), then calling Java functions requires
an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server. This project is a Java implementation of such server.

## Installation

Java RPC server can be downloaded from [releases](https://github.com/dsntk/dsntk-java-server/releases)
built from source or run in Docker container.

## Building from source

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Java 17 or newer.
3. Install Maven.
4. Build:

```shell
$ mvn package
```

The **server-0.0.1.jar** can be found in **./target** directory

## Starting the server

```shell
$ java -jar server-0.0.1.jar
```

## Docker container

Docker container can be built and run using prepared script file:

```shell
$ ./container.sh
```

After building, the new container is started and ready to accept requests, try:

```shell
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:22023/api/rest/v1/system/info
```

The output should look like this:

```shell
{"data": {"name": "Java RPC server for Decision Toolkit","version": "0.0.1"}}
```

## Endpoints

- **GET** http://127.0.0.1:22023/api/rest/v1/system/info

  Utility endpoint for checking the connectivity with the running server.

- **POST** http://127.0.0.1:22023/api/rest/v1/rpc/evaluate

  This endpoint is used directly by **Decision Toolkit** to evaluate Java functions.
